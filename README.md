# TETRISPog
tetris for mobile
followed tetris guidelines as close as possible;means scoring,tetrimino colors etc are same as tetris.

also uses pretty much all tetris systems i know of like the ghost piece, 7 bag system and super rotation system.

made in a week including assets(besides music,spongebob background and font).

uses raycasts instead of a grid system(this is not a good thing,makes it work much slower).


i couldnt show super rotation system here(literally skill issue) but it is there
